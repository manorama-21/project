      University of Allahabad has always occupied an esteemed place among the Universities of India for over a century. Established on 23rd September 1887, it is the fourth oldest University of India after Calcutta, Bombay and Madras University. The credit for conceiving a large Central College in Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj), eventually to develop into a University, goes to Sir William Muir, Lt. Governor of United Provinces. As a result of his initiative the foundation stone of the Muir Central College (named after him) was laid on Dec. 9 1873 by His Excellency Lord Northbrook. Sir William Muir said on the occasion; "The establishment of a central college at Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj) has been my earnest desire ever since I assumed my present office." Shortly after coming here I found that a strong wish prevailed among the chief people of the place for a better means of education at Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj); and being myself deeply impressed with the same conviction, I took occasion at the first Darbar which I held here to urge upon those present the necessity of showing that they were sincere and in earnest, by contributing to the work.

Harijan Sewak Sangh (Iswar Saran Ashram), the ancestral institution of the College was established in the year 1933 by Late Munshi Iswar Saran Ji (26 August 1874-1 January, 1947). The basic motivating goal and mission of this institution is to eradicate the discrimination based on caste, class and community prevalent in the Indian Society and to provide a momentum towards the road to reconstruction, development and modernization of the nation.</p>
<p>To fulfil this aim and acknowledging education as an important medium for it, Iswar Saran Ashram established many educational institutions. In this series, Iswar Saran Degree College, established in 1970, is animated with the basic goal and spirit of the founder and its ancestral institution. The Institution is specially committed to the fulfilment of the desire for higher education of the nation's youth in general and with special emphasis for the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, the neglected and marginalised sections of the society who have been denied social justice. At present the college offers courses from undergraduate to Ph.D.</p>
<p>The operation of the institution is to function as a workshop of the development of healthy, virtuous and skilled youth conforming to the needs of the nation. Here, apart from bookish knowledge, there is special approach and insistence on practical skills. Education in conformation with moral values and high humanistic ideals and goals is promoted along with the practice of self-study and collective thinking.

       Welcome to Arya Kanya Degree College, a prestigious College for women. The College was founded in 1975, the International year of women and is based on the noble principles of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, founder of Arya Samaj. It is a Constituent College of the University of Allahabad which achieved the status of Central University on 14 July, 2005. The College is located in Muthiganj, a thickly populated area of the city.</p>

<p>The goals and objectives of the College are focussed towards proper education of women. Our endeavour has been to promote independent thinking among young girls so that they may not only make responsible citizens that contribute to the growth of the national economy but play the role of an anchor in their own families.</p>

<p>The College takes pride in having rendered educational services to women in some of the most thickly populated areas of the city in which some of the poorest people reside and has produced the first female graduate from many a family. The College has an Arts faculty at present and the syllabi is set by the University. We offer programmes in subjects like English, Hindi, Sanskrit, Economics, Political Science, Philosphy, Education, Sociology, Ancient History, Medieval History, Music – Vocal and Instrumental.</p>

<p>Teaching is done through class-room lectures and tutorials. Audio-visual aids, specially screening of films based on the syllabi and over-head projectors are deployed besides running of CD/DVD to ensure proper imparting of the intricacies of the subject. Students are also guided through written work and to ensure its proper utility periodical assessments and half yearly examinations are conducted to fathom their understanding. The annual examination is conducted by the University and the College acts as an examination centre.
       </p>

               <p>Named after the eminent educationist and political leader of repute, Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the college was formally inaugurated by Dr Murli Manohar Joshi, Minister for Human Resource Development, Science & Technology   and Ocean Development on the auspicious day of Vijaya Dashmi, October 11, 1997. Given to the ever increasing demand for setting up a new college in an educationally un-served area of Phaphamau and also to relieve the University & its associated colleges from  the unbearable pressure of admission, a proposal for setting up a new Govt Degree College at Allahabad was sent to the State Govt on April 9, 1997 by the Directorate of Higher Education, UP Allahabad.</p>

<p>The State Govt, after duly examining the proposal, granted clearance vide Govt Order No: 2068 / 15-17-97-74(11)/ 97 Dated : May 30, 1997 in the subjects of Hindi, Sanskrit, English, Political Science , History, Geography, Philosophy , Defence Studies in the faculty of Arts ; Zoology, Botany, Physics, Chemistry and Maths in the Faculty of Science and Commerce and asked the  University of Allahabad accordingly, to initiate the process, under the provisions of the Statutes, for granting recognition to the college. The college building is not only the requirement for the Panel Inspection but equally indispensable for the start of the college. Since the construction of building takes its own time, circumstances necessitated upon the authorities to acquire / take over some building , currently not in use, for the purpose of starting the college.
</p>
<p>Fortunately , the Community Center in  Govt Mahila Polytechnic College, Teliyarganj, an spacious building of 20 rooms was located for this purpose and  by the order of the Dept of Technical Education, was handed over to the Dept of Higher Education in July, 1997 for  running the proposed college in the premises of  Govt Mahila Polytechnic College, Teliyarganj, Allahabad.</p>
