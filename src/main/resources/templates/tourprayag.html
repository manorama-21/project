              <p>The Indian High Courts Act, 1861 provided for the establishment of the Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras High Courts. It also reserved power in Her Majesty Queen Victoria to constitute similar High Courts in any other part of the country. The Letters Patent/Charter dated 17th March, 1866 was issued constituting the High Court of Judicature for North-Western Provinces which started functioning at Agra on 18th June, 1866. It shifted to Allahabad in 1869 and functioned in the building which now houses the Board of Revenue. On 27th November, 1916, it was shifted to its present building. The name of the High Court was changed to High Court of Judicature at Allahabad by Supplementary Letters Patent dated 11th March, 1919.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>In 1966, the centenary celebration of this Court took place. The celebration committee chaired by the then Honourable Chief Justice Sri Nasirullah Beg with Honourable Mr. Justice S.N. Katju as its honorary secretary conceived a plan to mount an exhibition of judicial records, photographs of Honourable Chief Justices and other artefacts during the centenary celebrations. The exhibition was highly appreciated by the visitors, including foreign dignitaries. Later it was decided to convert the exhibition into a museum of Court records. Therefore, a Museum was set up within the High Court premises containing very old and rare documents relating to the judicial system, landmark judgments, firmans of Mughal emperors, judgments in Persian language (which was the Court language during the British Period before the establishment of the High Court in 1866) and photographs of Honourable Chief Justices from 1866 up to the present arranged chronologically, the British emblem and photographs of Honourable Judges who were elevated as Judges and Chief Justices of Supreme Court of India, eminent members of the Bar and old furniture.</p>
         <br>
        <p>Thereafter, with financial aid from the State Government, a new independent building of the Law Museum and Archives was built. This was inaugurated in 2021 by the then Chief Justice, Shri Justice Govind Mathur. This is the only Law Museum of its kind in India.</p>
        
         <br><p>The Law Museum and Archives also contains valuable materials for research on the past judicial system and also the British judicial system in India. The rare and valuable documents and firmans of Mughal rulers and others, available in the Museum, provide glimpses of the old judicial system and administration.</p>
       
        <br> <p>The vision and mission is to preserve and showcase valuable materials on the judicial and administrative system of the past. The High Court Museum has a large collection of four to five hundred years old rare documents comprising of judgments, decrees, orders, rupkars, notices, deeds etc. relating to Sadar Diwani and other Adalats of the past and firmans of Mughal and other rulers, all written in Persian, which was the language of the court. These are invaluable records having archival and historical importance and are precious material for research work.</p>

                 <p>The Allahabad Museum is centrally located in the Civil Lines area of the city in a lush green garden at Chandrashekhar Azad Park, popularly known as Company Bagh. In 1863, the Board of Revenue requested the Government of North- Western Provinces for the establishment of a public library and a museum. With donations from the provincial government, the famous Orientalist Sir William Muir and the Maharaja of Vijaynagaram, a superintendent of the library and museum was appointed and an ornate building was inaugurated in 1878 to house the collection. For unforeseen reasons or due to paucity of fund the museum was closed down in 1881. With the initiative of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the President of the Allahabad Municipal Board and Pt. Brijmohan Vyas in the 1923-24 efforts were made to establish a new museum in the city. It was under the operational direction of Pandit Brij Mohan Vyas, the executive officer of the board, a museum was opened in the Municipal Building in 1931. Under the tutelage of Pandit Vyas, the museum acquired important collections, including ancient sculptures from Bharhut and Bhumra as well as the art collections of Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, Gaganendranath Tagore, Asit Kumar Haldar of the Bengal School Paintings also the collection of paintings of the European artists like Nicholas Roerich and Anagarik Govinda, a German monk whose collection enabled the museum to create galleries of modern art in the museum. In 1942, S.C. Kala the first curator gave the much needed impetus to enriching the collections of the museum, especially adding the Nehru Personalia Collection and as space became a constraint, it was decided that the museum should be shifted from the Municipal Board building to a new premises. The foundation stone of the present museum building was laid on 14th December 1947 by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and the museum was opened to the public in 1954 in the Chandra Sekhar Azad Park or the company bagh area. But the real turning point of the fate of the museum came in the year 1986 after realizing its significance of the diversity of its rich collections of archaeological artifacts, art treasures the museum was taken over by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India after constituting an autonomous body called Allahabad Museum Society, and declared it a museum of national importance under the Ministry of Culture Government of India. Presently the museum is under the financial control of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India and the ex-officio Chairman of the museum is the Governor of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>The Allahabad Museum has a rich and diversified collection of art, antiquities, paintings ,sculptures, coins, ceramics, archaeological objects, illustrated manuscripts, farmans, decorative art objects, arm &amp; armours, textiles, natural history specimen, photographs , prints and personalia collections pertaining to Gandhi, Nehru and Literary personalities of Allahabad like Sumitra Nandan Pant,Suryakant Tripathi âNiralaâ, Premchand, and Mahadevi Verma. The artefacts are displayed in sixteen different galleries including an Exhibition named in the memory of A.K. Coomaraswamy Memorial Hall and a Central hall where from time to time various temporary exhibitions on different themes are organised for the rotation of art objects and antiquities from the reserve collection of the museum.</p>

					<p>The New Yamuna Bridge is like a new feather in Prayagraj’s cap. The images speak about the stupendous architecture of the New Yamuna Bridge. The view of the bridge during dawn and dusk is mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Also known as the Naini Bridge, the New Yamuna Bridge is among India’s longest cable-stayed bridges. It runs across the Yamuna River in the North-South direction, connecting Prayagraj to Naini. It was constructed in the year 2004 to minimize the traffic congestions over the old Naini Bridge. The construction of the bridge was a joint responsibility of the Hindustan Construction Company and Hyundai Engineering and Construction.</p>
<p>The New Yamuna Bridge is also the first six-lane bridge in India built with modern design and structure. It has two pylons, made up of concrete material, that provide support to the major part of the deck of the bridge held together by steel cables. The bridge also acts as a road link between Prayagraj and NH-27 stretching across for 370 meters. The modern technology combined with environmental compatibility and excellent quality make for some of the features of this bridge that offer great benefits. India has a stupendous network of bridges and this bridge is a fine example of the country’s tremendous growth in infrastructure.</p>

					<p>Khusro Bagh is a large historical garden, in which tombs of Prince Khusro, the eldest son of Emperor Jahangir and Sultan Begum are located. The three sandstone mausoleums within this walled garden, represent an exquisite example of Mughal architecture. The design of its main entrance, the surrounding gardens and the three-tier tomb of Sultan Begum has been attributed to Aqa Reza, Jahangir’s principal court artist.</p>
<p>The tomb has a large chhatri that surmounts the plinth and inscriptions that adorn her tomb. Next to the Begum’s tomb is the tomb of Khusrau’s sister, Nithar. However Nithar’s mausoleum is empty and it does not contain her tomb within it. Architecturally, this is the most elaborate of the three. It lies on an elevated platform and is adorned with panels depicting the scalloped arch motif. Within the plinth are rooms, whose ceilings have been elaborately painted with stars in concentric circles. The central room has on its walls floral decorations depicting Persian cypresses, wine vessels, flowers and plants.</p>
<p>The tomb of Khusro is the last of the three tombs. Khusro was first imprisoned within the garden after he rebelled against his father Jahangir. He was killed in an attempt to escape on the orders of Khusro’s brother and Jahangir’s third son Khurram, who later became the Emperor Shah Jahan.</p>

					<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prayag, located in modern Allahabad, has an important place among Hindus as a pilgrimage. Traditionally, the confluence of rivers is considered very sacred, but the confluence of Sangam is considered very important. Because here the unique confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati takes place. According to mythology, Lord Vishnu was carrying a Kumbh (pot) full of Amrit, when four drops of Amrit fell during a scuffle with the demons. These drops fell in the pilgrimage places of Prayag, Haridwar, Nashik and Ujjain. A pilgrimage is a place where a devotee attains salvation from this mortal world. In such a situation, wherever the drops of Amrit fell, Kumbh Mela is organized there in turn at an interval of three years. Among these pilgrimages, Sangam is also known as Tirtharaj. Kumbh is organized every twelve years at Sangam.</font></font></p>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">confluence</font></font></h2>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the place where the muddy water of Ganga meets the green water of Yamuna. The Saraswati river, which is considered invisible, meets here. Although it is an invisible river, it is believed that it flows underground. The confluence is 7 km from Civil Lines. It can also be seen from the ramparts of Akbar's fort.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the holy Sangam, banks of water and wet mud are spread far and wide. Standing on a small platform in the middle of the river, priests perform rituals and prayers. For a devout Hindu, a dip in the Sangam is considered to purify life. Boats can be hired from near the fort for the Sangam. It is as if the Sangam comes alive during Kumbh/Mahakumbh. Devotees from all over the country and abroad come here and add to its splendor.</font></font></p>
